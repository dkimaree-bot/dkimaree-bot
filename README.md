## About Me

- I’m currently exploring areas like intelligent systems and automation, with the long-term goal of building my own tech-driven products and businesses.

- I’m especially interested in web development and how technology, design, and storytelling come together to create meaningful user experiences.

- Outside of pure coding, I have a strong background in creative writing and an interest in film, which shapes how I think about communication, structure, and audience.
